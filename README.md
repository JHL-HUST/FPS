Farsighted Probabilistic Sampling: A General Strategy for Boosting MaxSAT Local Search Solvers
----
This repository contains the code to the FPS algorithm for the MaxSAT proposed in our paper: <br> <br>
[Farsighted Probabilistic Sampling: A General Strategy for Boosting MaxSAT Local Search Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09988#) <br>
Jiongzhi Zheng, Kun He, Jianrong Zhou <br> <br>

Installation
----
On a Unix/Linux machine execute the following commands: <br> <br>

unzip FPS-main.zip <br>
cd FPS-main <br>
make <br> <br>

An executable file called FPS will now be available in the directory FPS-main. <br>
Then enter the command ./FPS instance_name, to run the algorithm. <br> <br>
